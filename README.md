a brief description of the website and its use case

The purpose for our project "The Druken RFC" is to pick a random RFC to get information about every day
   As I user:
   I WANT to broaden my developer knowledge by researching a random RFC every day. By doing so, I can be updated on any and all technical developments happening in the world. I never know what random fact can make or break my code and the more I know the better.
